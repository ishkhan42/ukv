/**
 * @file db.h
 * @author Ashot Vardanian
 * @date 12 Jun 2022
 * @brief C bindings for binary collections.
 *
 * @section Why prefer batch APIs?
 * Using the batch APIs to issue a single read/write request
 * is trivial, but achieving batch-level performance with
 * singular operations is impossible. Regardless of IO layer,
 * a lot of synchronization and locks must be issued to provide
 * consistency.
 *
 * @section Iterators
 * Implementing consistent iterators over concurrent state is exceptionally
 * expensive, thus we plan to implement those via "Pagination".
 *
 * @section Interface Conventions
 * 1. We try to expose just opaque struct pointers and functions to
 * 	  clients. This allows us to change internal representations
 *    without forcing clients to recompile code, that uses shared lib.
 * 2. Errors are encoded into NULL-terminated C strings.
 * 3. Functions that accept `collections`, @b can receive 0, 1 or N such
 *    arguments, where N is the number of passed `keys`.
 * 4. Collections, Iterators and Transactions are referencing the DB,
 *    so the DB shouldn't die/close before those objects are freed.
 *    This also allows us to reduce the number of function arguments for
 *    interface functions.
 * 5. Strides! Higher level systems may pack groups of arguments into AoS
 *    instead of SoA. To minimize the need of copies and data re-layout,
 *    we use @b byte-length strides arguments, similar to BLAS libraries.
 *    Passing Zero as a "stride" means repeating the same value.

 *
 * @section Upserts, Updates & Inserts
 * Higher-level interfaces may choose to implement any of those verbs:
 * 1. Insert: add if missing.
 * 2. Update: overwrite if present.
 * 3. Upsert: write.
 * Instead of adding all three to C interface, we focus on better ACID transactions,
 * which can be used to implement any advanced multi-step operations (often including
 * conditionals), like Compare-And-Swap, without losing atomicity.
 *
 * @section Why use offsets?
 *
 * In the underlying layer, using offsets to adds no additional overhead,
 * but what is the point of using them, if we can immediately pass adjusted
 * pointers?
 * It serves two primary purposes:
 * > Supporting input tapes (values_stride = 0, offsets_stride != 0).
 * > List-oriented wrappers (values_stride != 0, offsets_stride = 0).
 *
 * In the first case, we may have received a tape from `ukv_read`, which we
 * update in-place and write back, without changing the size of the original
 * entries.
 *
 * In the second case, we may be working with higher-level runtimes, like
 * CPython, where objects metadata (like its length) is stored in front of
 * the allocated region. In such cases, we may still need additional memory
 * to store the lengths of the objects, unless those are NULL-terminated
 * strings (lengths = NULL) or if all have the same length (length_stride = 0).
 *

 * different languages:
